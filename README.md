# Checksum Verifier by JARVIS-AI

**Version**: 1.7.2

A Python application built with Tkinter that calculates multiple hash checksums (CRC, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for input files. This app allows users to verify file integrity by choosing specific algorithms to check and supports outputting results within the app or saving them to a text file.

## Features

- **Multiple Checksum Algorithms**: Calculate CRC, MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes for any input file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple Tkinter-based GUI for easy selection of files and hash options.
- **Flexible Output Options**: Choose to view the results directly in the app or save them as a text file for later reference.
- **Customizable Checks**: Users can select which hash algorithms to check, making it versatile for different use cases.
